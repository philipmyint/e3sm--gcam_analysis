# e3sm--gcam_analysis
Analysis and plots of E3SM--GCAM simulations

TODO:
- Extraction of time series and spatial data from h0 files if the h0 files are printed out at arbitrary time intervals (not just months). 
- Add ability to plot spatial distribution of PFT categories (individual types and aggregated subgroups) and land unit types (e.g., vegetation fraction). Right now, can only make time series plots of PFT categories and land unit types.
